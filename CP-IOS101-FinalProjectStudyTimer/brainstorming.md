# Brainstorming

## Initial App Ideas

1. **StudyTimer (Pomodoro-like Study App)**  
   A simple focus‑timer that follows the Pomodoro technique (25 min work, 5 min break). Tracks sessions and lets you adjust durations.

2. **LanguageFlash**  
   A quick flashcard app for vocabulary review. Users can create decks, swipe through cards, and track which words they’ve learned.

3. **MealPrep Planner**  
   Plan your week’s meals, auto‑generate a grocery list, and mark off cooked meals. Includes recipe links and nutritional estimates.

4. **LocalSpotter**  
   Discover nearby coffee shops, parks, or small businesses. Uses location and map annotations to highlight hidden gems.

5. **Workout Bingo**  
   Gamify your fitness: each workout is a “square” on a bingo card. Complete rows for a small reward and track your streaks.

6. **PhotoCollage Maker**  
   Drag‑and‑drop photos into prebuilt collage templates, add captions and stickers, then save or share directly to social media.

## Evaluation of Top Two Ideas

### Idea 1: StudyTimer (Pomodoro Study App)

- **Mobile**  
  • Uses local notifications and vibration when sessions end → leverages phone’s native alerts.  
  • Timer continues in background.

- **Story**  
  • Clear value: helps students and remote workers stay focused.  
  • Friends would understand “I did four 25‑min sprints today.”

- **Market**  
  • Large audience: anyone who studies, codes, or works from home.  
  • Many Pomodoro apps exist, but a lightweight, customizable one can stand out.

- **Habit**  
  • Daily usage: users likely start multiple sessions per day.  
  • Builds study/work routines over time.

- **Scope**  
  • Core is just a timer + simple settings → achievable in this course.  
  • Stretch: session history or stats screen, but printable MVP is narrow.

### Idea 2: LanguageFlash (Flashcards)

- **Mobile**  
  • Swipe gestures feel natural on touch devices.  
  • Could record audio pronunciations (uses mic/audio).

- **Story**  
  • Strong narrative: “learn 5 new words every day.”  
  • Friends learning languages would appreciate it.

- **Market**  
  • Competitive space (Anki, Quizlet), but niche for ultra‑simple decks with spaced repetition.

- **Habit**  
  • Daily habit for language learners.  
  • Easy to open, review 5–10 cards in under 5 min.

- **Scope**  
  • Basic version (create/view cards) is doable.  
  • Full spaced‑repetition algorithm adds complexity—optional stretch.

## Final App Idea Chosen

**StudyTimer (Pomodoro Study App)**  
I’m going to build a focused‑timer app with:

- Customizable work/break durations  
- Start/Pause/Reset controls with background notifications  
- Dark‑mode UI and an optional settings screen to change the timings
- (Stretch) Simple session history or weekly goal tracker  

This has a tight, well‑scoped MVP, clear mobile‑specific features, and will be easy to demo and polish within the capstone timeline.
